                                    <p> In today's digital age there is no doubt companies gaining a competitive advantage with data to improve operational efficiency, and drive revenue growth.</p>


                                      <p>From extracting valuable insights from your data or daily operations. You are likely in the 8 out of 10 companies that don't know about data quality and integrity to be AI Ready.how shiny and amazing new solutions are, they all require rocket fuel to help them blast off </p>

                                      <h2>My Experiencee</h2>
                                    <p> Through my experience in start-ups and established companies, I aim to showcase the cost-effectiveness of my consulting services by
                                    addressing issues early on in the process. This can prevent them from escalating and affecting other systems, which can be time-consuming,
                                    expensive, and resource-intensive to rectify afterwards. Whether you are a developer, product owner, data analyst or scientist, you may have
                                    encountered gaps in data between transactional systems and reporting and analytics systems. I will provide examples to help you understand why
                                    this happens and how it can impact business growth. Even if you are not a tech person, my examples will help you grasp the importance of finding
                                    a balance between business growth and costs.

                                      <h2>Why this Matter?</h2>
                                    <p> Insufficient manpower for software engineers and data foundation knowledge has resulted in technical debt at the core of software development - the data. The next big challenge for companies is organizational and centered around data. A "Modern Data Act 2" is needed to engineer data foundations and improve data quality standards in the era of increasing AI. Companies that don't keep up with these changes will fall behind.

                                     <hr>
                                    Data quality is the foundation upon which data science rests. Without reliable and accurate data, any insights or decisions derived from data analysis are likely to be flawed. In fact, poor data quality can lead to significant business losses and damage to reputation. Therefore, it is imperative for companies to prioritize data quality when undertaking any data-related initiatives.
<hr>
Currently, the field of data science is experiencing a gap when it comes to data quality. Despite its importance, many organizations still do not have a formalized approach to data quality. Some may simply rely on the data that is readily available to them without considering the reliability of the sources, while others may have a quality control process in place that is not rigorous enough to detect all errors and inconsistencies in the data.
<hr>
Additionally, while there are numerous case studies and examples available online that showcase the application of data science in a business context, very few of them provide a comprehensive view of the data science process. Often, these examples highlight the technical aspects of data science, without adequately addressing the crucial business and operational considerations that underpin any successful data science project.

                                    Companies often struggle to implement data science effectively due to a lack of data culture, processes, and standard operating procedures, which can lead to missed opportunities for growth and innovation.
                                    Poor data quality, inconsistent formats, and siloed data sources can also pose challenges for data science initiatives. To overcome these challenges, companies must prioritize data-driven decision making and establish clear processes and procedures for data management, including data quality standards,
                                    governance practices, and proper documentation. Building a strong data culture and implementing effective data management practices are essential for realizing the full potential of data science in businesses.</p>
